# Multi_Program_Installer
This is the multi-installer, similar to the single-installer
This will take multiple EXE files from a directory(folder) and install them for you one at a time
Although manually gathering the EXE files for installation may defeat the purpose of this "auto-installer", this is still a good project for new computer setups
You can add as many installers as you want to the directory and code
The only thing you need to do is confirm or deny installs for files

Feel free to edit the code and apply it to your projects or turn it into an EXE file of its own for easier running
